      <h2>Our final product comprises working image manipulations including a “shredder” which shreds an image with smooth strip-like effect, “confetti” manipulation which creates a particle-like video-effect on the image, and a working baseline web application that provides a web-app layout that allows the user to choose an effect they want to apply to the uploaded image they provide. </h2>
